# Wave-analyzer

This project is a wave analyser which reads audio input from a microphone and outputs both numerical and graphical data about the captured sound waves. 

The program usex 4 classes: main.py, input.py, analysis.py, visualization.py.
    

1) Audion capture
2) Analysis (frequency, amplitude, waveform graph and maybe a spectrogram)
3) Real time streaming
